# Bread-N-Butter

This semester-project for CS-205 at Lafayette College is intended to provide a desktop application that allows for the management and adoption of an inventory of pets.
Client applications will the computers of potential adopting-parents, shelter owners, and administrators.
These applications will communicate with a central server (also included in this repository) which will handle data persistence, access control, and pet-matching.
This service will provide not only basic inventory management, but also robust algorithmic matching features designed to pair pets with the perfect parent.

## Setup

In order to run this application successfully, both the client and the server software must be running concurrently. Instructions for each are included below.

### Starting the Server

The server can be started by simply launching the `server` executable created during the build process.
This will eventually be made configurable with command-line flags but for now, the server is hard-coded to listen on `http://0.0.0.0:1312`

### Starting the Client

TODO: Add client setup instructions.
