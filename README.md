# Bread-N-Butter

This semester-project for CS-205 at Lafayette College is intended to provide a desktop application that allows for the management and adoption of an inventory of pets.
Client applications will the computers of potential adopting-parents, shelter owners, and administrators.
These applications will communicate with a central server (also included in this repository) which will handle data persistence, access control, and pet-matching.
This service will provide not only basic inventory management, but also robust algorithmic matching features designed to pair pets with the perfect parent.
